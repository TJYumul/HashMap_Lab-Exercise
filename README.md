# HashMap_Lab-Exercise

This Java-based library management system reads author and book data from CSV files and stores them in `HashMap` collections for efficient retrieval. The `AuthorDA` class loads author details, while `BookDA` links books to their respective authors. The `BookReport` class generates a formatted report displaying each bookâ€™s title, ISBN, and author information. The system ensures seamless data management and retrieval, making it a simple yet effective solution for handling book and author records.
